# Log4Shell log4j Mass Scanner
Log4Shell (log4j) Mass Discovery 


Greetings, during this hard days when security teams need to scan their personal or corporate environments and find Log4Shell vulnerability in their systems
I would like to contribute my personal method of Log4Shell Vulnerability detection, contributions are accepted for any type of improvement.

This script first imports the necessary libraries and sets up a logger. It then defines the target IP range and port to scan. It splits the IP range into individual IP addresses and uses a for loop to iterate over each IP. For each IP, it attempts to connect to the specified port and logs a message if the connection was successful. If an exception is encountered, it is logged as an error.

I do not take any responsibility for any damages that could arise from using this script, please use it at your own risk.
